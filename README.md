# bank-customer-churn-dashboard
It is the Bank customer churn dashboard built using Power BI. I have analysed data across various categories such as satisfaction rate, complain rate, according to gender, age and a lot more.
I used DAX formulas to create measures and columns to analyse and visualize the data in detailed and comprehensive manner.
It includes multiple reports according to different analysis and visualization criteria such as different reports for "Gender Based Analysis" and another different report for "Age Based Analysis".

**Check the screen recording of the dashboard from here** :- https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7164312659830530049/

**Below are the images and various insight that we found from the analysis and the possibel reason for it**

**1) Insight from the Main Report of the Dashboard :-**

![Customer Exited from main report page](https://github.com/ujjwal717/bank-customer-churn-dashboard/assets/93403224/b06ea9cc-ca81-49d3-8250-80327364fff1)


**A) Customers by Complain :-** Complains are the requests/reports/problems that customers files in the bank for any inconvenience

Insight :- We can see that out of 2038 customers that exited the bank, 2034 customers had complains.

Possible Reasons :- They might have exited the bank because their problem would not have been addressed properly.



**B) Customer by Satisfaction Score :-** Satisfaction Score is the score provided by the customers after solution of hus/her problems.

Insight :- It can be seen that around 40% of the customers that exited gave bad (less than 3 out of 5) satisfaction score.

Possible Reason :- They might not have been satisfied from the resolution that they got or the customer executive could have been rude.


**C) Customers by Credit Score :-**

Insight :- Maximum customers that exited the bank were having bad credit score. Many of them also hasd good credit score and least were having excellent credit score.

Possible Reason :- The reason that customers having bad credit score exited the bank might be from the fact that they might have applied for any kind of load and got rejected because of bad credit score. 


Some more analysis in brief :- 

1) Average Salary of exited customers is 101.5k USD.
2) Average Age of exited customers is 44.8
3) Out of 2038 exited customers, 1303 were Inactive
4) Out of 2038 exited customers, 735 were Active




**2) Insight from Gender Report of the Dashboard :-**

**A) Customers by Card Type and Gender :-**

Insight :- It can be seen that out of exited customers, for each and every card type, female customers have exited the bank more than the male customers. On the contrary if we select **"No"** in the customer exited slicer, we can see that male customers are more for having all the different kind of cards so, male customers exit less than female customers for every card type.

Possible Reason :- It is really difficult to pin-point a specific reason for that.
