# bank-customer-churn-dashboard
It is the Bank customer churn dashboard built using Power BI. I have analysed data across various categories such as satisfaction rate, complain rate, according to gender, age and a lot more.
I used DAX formulas to create measures and columns to analyse and visualize the data in detailed and comprehensive manner.
It includes multiple reports according to different analysis and visualization criteria such as different reports for "Gender Based Analysis" and another different report for "Age Based Analysis"
